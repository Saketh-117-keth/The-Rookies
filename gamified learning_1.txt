Problem:
I have seen then struggles of the people in rural area striving for quality education which is not available in the rural areas.
Language barriers make it even worse.
There resources are too low.

Why gamified learning ?
Gamified learning : which involves applying game design elements to educational settings, offers multiple cognitive, emotional, and social benefits that significantly enhance student learning experiences and outcomes.
1. Through gamified learning we can make learning interactive.
2. Instead of learning through boring traditional  method. It makes learning enjoyable and fun.
3. Promoted Critical thinking and problem solving skills.
4. Creates a positive ,stress free learning.
5. Enhances Cognitive and Emotional Development
6. Reduces dropout rates by keeping students motivated.
7. Promotes language inclusivity and comprehension in rural areas.


Why not Traditional learning ?
Traditional learning is nothing but schooling , mugging .
Where practical knowledge lacks.
Hence the traditional learning is not that effective as gamified learning.
