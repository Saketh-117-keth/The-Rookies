When students see rewards, achievements, they feel motivated to continue learning.

 THE FUTUER SCOPE  WITH AI AND INTEGRATED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY:
HOW AI WORKS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1) It automatically adjusts the difficulty level. If a student finds the topic easy AI promotes difficult questions, if difficult it promotes easy to moderate questions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 2) It finds the mistakes rapidly and gives the correct solution which reduces frustration of students when they are stuck.                                                                   3) AI can suggest relevant topics, exercises and quizzes on what the student is studying.                                                                                                                       4) It also predicts where they might struggle in future.
HOW QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY WORKS                                                                                                                                                                                             1) It works on cubits instead of bits. So it works even more faster.                                                                                                                                                                                        2) So multiple solutions can be analyzed at a time.                                                                                                                                                                                 3) Because of superposition and entanglement it performs many calculations at a time.                                                                                                                 4) Can run complex activities without slowing down the app, even if many students use the app simultaneously.                                                                                5) High accuracy.
