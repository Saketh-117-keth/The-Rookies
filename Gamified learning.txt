Problem statement :

Generally rural students lack quality education. There are many reasons like :
> Not having efficient faculty.
> They are not yet digitally engaged.
> They are still following traditional methods.
> Poor internet connectivity which does not let them learn online and many.

 OBJECTIVE :

Our idea is to make learning interactive and enjoyable through gamified learning to bridge the education gap between rural and urban areas by creating a lightweight, multilingual and an offline capable platform that motivates students to learn core subjects in an enjoyable way.

KEY FEATURES :

> Our app is like an open source library. We provide textbooks, magazines, articles etc.
> Levels and Rewards: Students progress through levels by completing quizzes and activities. Rewards like stars or badges encourage enjoyable and consistent learning.
> Multi-language support: Lessons are available in regional languages like Telugu, Hindi, Tamil, Malayalam, Kannada and Bengali for better understanding.
> Offline access: Works even without internet, ensuring usability in areas with poor connectivity.
> Curriculum - Based content: Covers subjects like Maths, Science, Social and languages from classes 1 to 10.
> Interactive quizzes and story telling: Uses story telling, puzzles, and visual learning to simplify complex topics.
> Teacher dashboard: Allows teachers to track student progress and performance. 
> We use simple language which helps student understand the concepts easily.
> It occupies less storage to download our app.

GAMIFIED LEARNING :

> Improves motivation.
> Provides practical knowledge through visual teaching.
> Promotes continuous learning.
> Provides instant feedback.
> Builds digital literacy.
> Enhances retention.

HOW AI IS IMPLEMENTED IN OUR PLATFORM :

> It automatically adjusts the difficulty level.
> If a student finds the topic easy AI promotes difficult questions, if difficult it promotes easy to moderate questions.
> It finds the mistakes and gives the correct solution which reduces frustration when students are stuck.
> AI suggests relevant topics, exercises and quizzes on what topic student is studying.
> It also predicts where they might struggle in future.
      HOW QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY WORKS
> It works on cubits instead of bits. So it works even more faster.
> So multiple solutions can be analysed at a time.
> Because of superposition and entangledment it performs many calculations at a time.
> Can run complex activities without slowing down the app simultaneously.
> High accuracy.

 BENEFITS :

> Makes learning fun and engaging through game mechanisms.
> Reduces dropout rates by keeping students motivated.
> Provides access to quality education where teachers or schools are limited.
> Encourages self-paced learning .
> Promotes language inclusivity and comprehension in rural areas.
